# RaisinClassification
CS 435 Machine Learning: Raisin Classification Project
This project aims to use machine learning to classify raisins based on their geometric attributes. A dataset that describes 900 different images of raisins by seven different geometric attributes, including area, major/minor axis length, eccentricity, convex area, extent, and perimeter, will be utilized. This dataset will be used to train and analyze the performance of various machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, etc. These machine learning models will be used to classify the different raisins in the dataset into binary classes, either Kecimen or Bensi raisins.
